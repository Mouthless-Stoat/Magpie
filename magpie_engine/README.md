## Terminology

There words that have different meaning depending on which part of the fandom you come from but this is what this crate called each thing use in the documentation.

-   Set: A set is collection of cards something like sets in Magic the Gathering. Fanscryption call them format and IMF call them rulesets.
-   Mox Color:, The docs will mention mox using their color instead of using gem color because it just less confusing that way:
    -   Orange: Orange or Ruby Mox.
    -   Green: Green or Emerald Mox.
    -   Blue: Blue and Sapphire Mox.
    -   Gray: Gray Prism Mox. We call them "Gray" because every other Mox is refer to by its color and so will prism.
